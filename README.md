Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, Retinal_Blood_Vessel_Segmentation.ipynb, which provides a practical guide for segmenting retinal blood vessels from medical images. The project utilizes digital image processing and machine learning techniques to identify and separate blood vessels from other areas within a retinal fundus image. This process is crucial for the analysis of eye conditions like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.

Key Features
1. Blood Vessel Segmentation: The notebook implements a complete workflow for segmenting retinal blood vessels.

2. Popular Libraries: The code leverages popular Python libraries such as scikit-image, numpy, and matplotlib for image processing and visualization.

3. Practical Implementation: The code can serve as a hands-on guide for researchers and developers interested in medical image processing applications.
